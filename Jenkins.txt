Ansible, an open-source automation tool, serves multiple purposes including configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It operates through a declarative paradigm, where the desired system state is defined rather than scripting specific commands. Utilizing SSH for communication with target systems, Ansible stands out as agentless and straightforward to configure.

The foundation of Ansible lies in its components:

Inventory: A file listing target hosts for Ansible tasks, which can either be static or dynamically generated.

Playbooks: YAML files delineating tasks and configurations to be executed on target hosts.

Tasks: These are the atomic units of work in Ansible, representing actions to be carried out on target hosts.

Modules: Ansible offers an extensive library of modules catering to various tasks such as package installation, file manipulation, and service management.

Roles: Reusable units of playbooks, roles encompass related tasks, handlers, variables, and files, organized within a directory structure.
